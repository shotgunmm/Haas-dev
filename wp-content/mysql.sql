He bought a bought a farm in Yakima, Washington and instead of growing Clusters and Fuggles hops (which were seeded and of bad picking quality), he implemented a program to reduce the seed content and improve the picking quality of his hops.

He bought a bought a farm in Yakima, Washington and instead of growing Clusters and Fuggles hops (which were seeded and of bad picking quality), he implemented a program to reduce the seed content and improve the picking quality of his hops. He named the hop, and his farm, Yakima Golding and the brewers responded in droves.

His name was John I. Haas. One of his regular patrons was a mid-sized hop trader by the name of Mr. Bing who saw a spark in John (or John I., as his friends called him). Mr. Bing’s dream of expanding his hop business into the US would finally come to reality by engaging this energetic young man to do it.

It was the beginning of World War I, which was followed by Prohibition and Depression – all not conducive to support a start-up hop business. But despite all odds, his business grew because of his initiative to look for customers outside the United States. In particular, John I. built strong relationships with Canadian brewers who, not surprisingly, were benefiting greatly from American Prohibition. In 1925, Haas acquired its first hop farm in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia (which eventually grew to 1,300 acres).\r\n\r\nBy 1931, John I. sensed a change in what the world’s brewers were looking for. Up to that time, the most endearing quality of American hops was their low price (based on efficient farming units and strong yields) but their quality was dismal. John I. set out to change that paradigm by buying a farm in Yakima, Washington and implementing a program to reduce the seed content and improve the picking quality of his hops. In addition to his excellent timing (1933 was the repeal of Prohibition), brewers responded so favorably to his quality oriented hop farms (branded as Yakima Golding Farms) that Haas eventually became the largest private hop grower in the world with 25 farms and almost 4,000 acres.'),(2028,265,'_about-history_1_about-history-left','field_548f0e74607f3'),(2029,265,'about-history_1_about-history-right','<a href=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-68\" src=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond.jpg\" alt=\"prohibition-beyond\" width=\"293\" height=\"149\" /></a>\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62\" src=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\" alt=\"prohibition-beyond2\" width=\"297\" height=\"141\" /></a>'),(2030,265,'_about-history_1_about-history-right','field_548f0e87607f4'),(2031,265,'about-history_2_about-history-header','HAAS AND BARTH.

It was the US processing capabilities of Haas that peeked the interest of another market leader, namely Joh. Barth &amp; Sohn, Germany, under the leadership of Henry Barth. As much as Henry Barth and John I. were the fiercest of competitors, Fred Haas was able to find common ground and, having no children of his own, saw a continuation of his company in the hands of the Barth family that started in the hop business already in 1794.

Mr. Bing’s dream of expanding his hop business into the US would finally come to reality by engaging this energetic young man to do it.

It was the beginning of World War I, which was followed by Prohibition and Depression – all not conducive to support a start-up hop business. But despite all odds, his business grew because of his initiative to look for customers outside the United States. In particular, John I. built strong relationships with Canadian brewers who, not surprisingly, were benefiting greatly from American Prohibition. In 1925, Haas acquired its first hop farm in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia (which eventually grew to 1,300 acres).\r\n\r\nBy 1931, John I. sensed a change in what the world’s brewers were looking for.

As much as Henry Barth and John I. were the fiercest of competitors, Fred Haas was able to find common ground and, having no children of his own, saw a continuation of his company in the hands of the Barth family that started in the hop business already in 1794.

In particular, John I. built strong relationships with Canadian brewers who, not surprisingly, were benefiting greatly from American Prohibition. In 1925, Haas acquired its first hop farm in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia (which eventually grew to 1,300 acres).\r\n\r\nBy 1931, John I. sensed a change in what the world’s brewers were looking for. Up to that time, the most endearing quality of American hops was their low price (based on efficient farming units and strong yields) but their quality was dismal.John I. set out to change that paradigm by buying a farm in Yakima, Washington and implementing a program to reduce the'),(4566,648,'_about-history_1_about-history-left','field_548f0e74607f3'),(4567,648,'about-history_1_about-history-right','seed content and improve the picking quality of his hops.

In 1925, Haas acquired its first hop farm in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia (which eventually grew to 1,300 acres). By 1931, John I. sensed a change in what the world’s brewers were looking for. Up to that time, the most endearing quality of American hops was their low price (based on efficient farming units and strong yields) but their quality was dismal.John I. set out to change that paradigm by buying a farm in Yakima, Washington and implementing a program to reduce the seed content the picking quality of his hops.'),(6417,714,'_about-history_1_about-history-left','field_548f0e74607f3'),(6418,714,'about-history_1_about-history-right','In addition to his excellent timing (1933 was the repeal of Prohibition), brewers responded so favorably to his quality oriented hop farms (branded as Yakima and improve  Golding Farms) that Haas eventually became the largest private hop grower in the world with 25 farms and almost 4,000 acres.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n<a href=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-68\" src=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond.jpg\" alt=\"prohibition-beyond\" width=\"293\" height=\"149\" /></a> -->\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62\" src=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\" alt=\"prohibition-beyond2\" width=\"297\" height=\"141\" /></a>'),(6419,714,'_about-history_1_about-history-right','field_548f0e87607f4'),(6420,714,'about-history_2_about-history-header','HAAS AND BARTH.

In particular, John I. built strong relationships with Canadian brewers who, not surprisingly, were benefiting greatly from American Prohibition. In 1925, Haas acquired its first hop farm in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia (which eventually grew to 1,300 acres). By 1931, John I. sensed a change in what the world’s brewers were looking for. Up to that time, the most endearing quality of American hops was their low price (based on efficient farming units and strong yields) but their quality was dismal.John I. set out to change that paradigm by buying a farm in Yakima, Washington and implementing a program to reduce the seed content the picking quality of his hops.'),(6508,716,'_about-history_1_about-history-left','field_548f0e74607f3'),(6509,716,'about-history_1_about-history-right','In addition to his excellent timing (1933 was the repeal of Prohibition), brewers responded so favorably to his quality oriented hop farms (branded as Yakima and improve  Golding Farms) that Haas eventually became the largest private hop grower in the world with 25 farms and almost 4,000 acres.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n<a href=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-68\" src=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond.jpg\" alt=\"prohibition-beyond\" width=\"293\" height=\"149\" /></a> -->\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62\" src=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\" alt=\"prohibition-beyond2\" width=\"297\" height=\"141\" /></a>'),(6510,716,'_about-history_1_about-history-right','field_548f0e87607f4'),(6511,716,'about-history_2_about-history-header','HAAS AND BARTH.

In 1925, Haas acquired its first hop farm in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia (which eventually grew to 1,300 acres). By 1931, John I. sensed a change in what the world’s brewers were looking for. Up to that time, the most endearing quality of American hops was their low price (based on efficient farming units and strong yields) but their quality was dismal.John I. set out to change that paradigm by buying a farm in Yakima, Washington and implementing a program to reduce the seed content the picking quality of his hops.'),(6896,724,'_about-history_1_about-history-left','field_548f0e74607f3'),(6897,724,'about-history_1_about-history-right','In addition to his excellent timing (1933 was the repeal of Prohibition), brewers responded so favorably to his quality oriented hop farms (branded as Yakima and improve Golding Farms) that Haas eventually became the largest private hop grower in the world with 25 farms and almost 4,000 acres.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n<a href=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-68\" src=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond.jpg\" alt=\"prohibition-beyond\" width=\"293\" height=\"149\" /></a> -->\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62\" src=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\" alt=\"prohibition-beyond2\" width=\"297\" height=\"141\" /></a>'),(6898,724,'_about-history_1_about-history-right','field_548f0e87607f4'),(6899,724,'about-history_2_about-history-header','HAAS AND BARTH.

In particular, John I. built strong relationships with Canadian brewers who, not surprisingly, were benefiting greatly from American Prohibition. In 1925, Haas acquired its first hop farm in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia (which eventually grew to 1,300 acres). By 1931, John I. sensed a change in what the world’s brewers were looking for. Up to that time, the most endearing quality of American hops was their low price (based on efficient farming units and strong yields) but their quality was dismal.John I. set out to change that paradigm by buying a farm in Yakima, Washington and implementing a program to reduce the seed content the picking quality of his hops.'),(6992,725,'_about-history_1_about-history-left','field_548f0e74607f3'),(6993,725,'about-history_1_about-history-right','In addition to his excellent timing (1933 was the repeal of Prohibition), brewers responded so favorably to his quality oriented hop farms (branded as Yakima and improve Golding Farms) that Haas eventually became the largest private hop grower in the world with 25 farms and almost 4,000 acres.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n<a href=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-68\" src=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond.jpg\" alt=\"prohibition-beyond\" width=\"293\" height=\"149\" /></a> -->\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62\" src=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\" alt=\"prohibition-beyond2\" width=\"297\" height=\"141\" /></a>'),(6994,725,'_about-history_1_about-history-right','field_548f0e87607f4'),(6995,725,'about-history_2_about-history-header','HAAS AND BARTH.

In particular, John I. built strong relationships with Canadian brewers who, not surprisingly, were benefiting greatly from American Prohibition. In 1925, Haas acquired its first hop farm in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia (which eventually grew to 1,300 acres). By 1931, John I. sensed a change in what the world’s brewers were looking for. Up to that time, the most endearing quality of American hops was their low price (based on efficient farming units and strong yields) but their quality was dismal.John I. set out to change that paradigm by buying a farm in Yakima, Washington and implementing a program to reduce the seed content the picking quality of his hops.'),(7360,739,'_about-history_1_about-history-left','field_548f0e74607f3'),(7361,739,'about-history_1_about-history-right','In addition to his excellent timing (1933 was the repeal of Prohibition), brewers responded so favorably to his quality oriented hop farms (branded as Yakima and improve Golding Farms) that Haas eventually became the largest private hop grower in the world with 25 farms and almost 4,000 acres.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n<a href=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-68\" src=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond.jpg\" alt=\"prohibition-beyond\" width=\"293\" height=\"149\" /></a> -->\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62\" src=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\" alt=\"prohibition-beyond2\" width=\"297\" height=\"141\" /></a>'),(7362,739,'_about-history_1_about-history-right','field_548f0e87607f4'),(7363,739,'about-history_2_about-history-header','HAAS AND BARTH.

In particular, John I. built strong relationships with Canadian brewers who, not surprisingly, were benefiting greatly from American Prohibition. In 1925, Haas acquired its first hop farm in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia (which eventually grew to 1,300 acres). By 1931, John I. sensed a change in what the world’s brewers were looking for. Up to that time, the most endearing quality of American hops was their low price (based on efficient farming units and strong yields) but their quality was dismal.John I. set out to change that paradigm by buying a farm in Yakima, Washington and implementing a program to reduce the seed content the picking quality of his hops.'),(7715,750,'_about-history_1_about-history-left','field_548f0e74607f3'),(7716,750,'about-history_1_about-history-right','In addition to his excellent timing (1933 was the repeal of Prohibition), brewers responded so favorably to his quality oriented hop farms (branded as Yakima and improve Golding Farms) that Haas eventually became the largest private hop grower in the world with 25 farms and almost 4,000 acres.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n<a href=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-68\" src=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond.jpg\" alt=\"prohibition-beyond\" width=\"293\" height=\"149\" /></a> -->\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62\" src=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\" alt=\"prohibition-beyond2\" width=\"297\" height=\"141\" /></a>'),(7717,750,'_about-history_1_about-history-right','field_548f0e87607f4'),(7718,750,'about-history_2_about-history-header','HAAS AND BARTH.

In particular, John I. built strong relationships with Canadian brewers who, not surprisingly, were benefiting greatly from American Prohibition. In 1925, Haas acquired its first hop farm in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia (which eventually grew to 1,300 acres). By 1931, John I. sensed a change in what the world’s brewers were looking for. Up to that time, the most endearing quality of American hops was their low price (based on efficient farming units and strong yields) but their quality was dismal.John I. set out to change that paradigm by buying a farm in Yakima, Washington and implementing a program to reduce the seed content the picking quality of his hops.'),(7813,752,'_about-history_1_about-history-left','field_548f0e74607f3'),(7814,752,'about-history_1_about-history-right','In addition to his excellent timing (1933 was the repeal of Prohibition), brewers responded so favorably to his quality oriented hop farms (branded as Yakima and improve Golding Farms) that Haas eventually became the largest private hop grower in the world with 25 farms and almost 4,000 acres.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n<a href=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-68\" src=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond.jpg\" alt=\"prohibition-beyond\" width=\"293\" height=\"149\" /></a> -->\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62\" src=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\" alt=\"prohibition-beyond2\" width=\"297\" height=\"141\" /></a>'),(7815,752,'_about-history_1_about-history-right','field_548f0e87607f4'),(7816,752,'about-history_2_about-history-header','HAAS AND BARTH.

In particular, John I. built strong relationships with Canadian brewers who, not surprisingly, were benefiting greatly from American Prohibition. In 1925, Haas acquired its first hop farm in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia (which eventually grew to 1,300 acres). By 1931, John I. sensed a change in what the world’s brewers were looking for. Up to that time, the most endearing quality of American hops was their low price (based on efficient farming units and strong yields) but their quality was dismal.John I. set out to change that paradigm by buying a farm in Yakima, Washington and implementing a program to reduce the seed content the picking quality of his hops.'),(7964,757,'_about-history_1_about-history-left','field_548f0e74607f3'),(7965,757,'about-history_1_about-history-right','In addition to his excellent timing (1933 was the repeal of Prohibition), brewers responded so favorably to his quality oriented hop farms (branded as Yakima and improve Golding Farms) that Haas eventually became the largest private hop grower in the world with 25 farms and almost 4,000 acres.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n<a href=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-68\" src=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond.jpg\" alt=\"prohibition-beyond\" width=\"293\" height=\"149\" /></a> -->\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62\" src=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\" alt=\"prohibition-beyond2\" width=\"297\" height=\"141\" /></a>'),(7966,757,'_about-history_1_about-history-right','field_548f0e87607f4'),(7967,757,'about-history_2_about-history-header','HAAS AND BARTH.

In particular, John I. built strong relationships with Canadian brewers who, not surprisingly, were benefiting greatly from American Prohibition. In 1925, Haas acquired its first hop farm in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia (which eventually grew to 1,300 acres). By 1931, John I. sensed a change in what the world’s brewers were looking for. Up to that time, the most endearing quality of American hops was their low price (based on efficient farming units and strong yields) but their quality was dismal.John I. set out to change that paradigm by buying a farm in Yakima, Washington and implementing a program to reduce the seed content the picking quality of his hops.'),(8105,784,'_about-history_1_about-history-left','field_548f0e74607f3'),(8106,784,'about-history_1_about-history-right','In addition to his excellent timing (1933 was the repeal of Prohibition), brewers responded so favorably to his quality oriented hop farms (branded as Yakima and improve Golding Farms) that Haas eventually became the largest private hop grower in the world with 25 farms and almost 4,000 acres.\r\n\r\n<!--\r\n<a href=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-68\" src=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond.jpg\" alt=\"prohibition-beyond\" width=\"293\" height=\"149\" /></a> -->\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62\" src=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\" alt=\"prohibition-beyond2\" width=\"297\" height=\"141\" /></a>'),(8107,784,'_about-history_1_about-history-right','field_548f0e87607f4'),(8108,784,'about-history_2_about-history-header','HAAS AND BARTH.

morning,\r\n\r\n\r\nThis is Mark with BNSF Logistics, we provide OTR , IM and LTL  transportation services to variety of customers nationwide at some very competitive rates and I would love to offer these same services to You.  We have over 30K contracted carriers in our portfolio so there isn’t a shipment that we cannot \r\n\r\nhandle.  BNSF is all about service and our on time delivery exceeds 98% nationwide so whether you need some help with your inbound freight (raw materials) or your outbound freight (finished goods) we can certainly assist.  Our unique and signature characteristic is the “1-point contact feature” we \r\n\r\noffer and what this means is that regardless if You award me with 5 loads per week or 25 loads per week I would still be the only person You would ever have to deal with @ BNSF, no 1-800 numbers that never get answered or emails that never get replied.  I am available to my customers pretty much 24/7.\r\n\r\nWe are not the “one man broker operation” who works out of his house, the kind of broker that goes out of business when the first significant claim comes around.

What should I do?</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>A slight precipitate adhering to the bottom of the product jug is not uncommon and will not affect the quality of the product nor be problematic in dosing. Carefully decant the liquid from the jug into your dosing vessel. Any particulate material that gets into the vessel will be dissolved if the vessel is heated to approximately 30 deg. C. and agitated. If you dose directly from the original jug, the precipitate can be re-dissolved by heating the jug and contents to approximately 50 deg. C. with gentle agitation.\r\n\r\n</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>How soon should the hop product be used once the original package is opened?</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>If stored at cool temperature, the product should be used within a few days, or a week at most. For longer storage, the headspace in the jug should be flushed with nitrogen and then resealed. DO NOT use air or CO2 to flush the headspace.\r\n\r\n</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>What if a hop product dosing vessel is used? How long can it be stored there?</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Often, dosing vessels are heated to a temperature of about 30 deg. C. or more. This will help the product stay in solution, but over time, will result in a drop in the concentration of bitter components in the solution. If the product is not to be used within a couple of days, the temperature should be reduced and, if the vessel can be sealed, the headspace can be flushed with nitrogen. This will allow the product to be stored for about two weeks. The product should be heated and agitated again prior to the next dosing cycle. The dosing vessel is not a good long-term storage device for the hop product, and care should be taken to utilize the product efficiently to reduce the occurrence of excess volume stored between dosing cycles that lasts more than a couple of days.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Can I combine different hop products, e.g. Redihop and Tetrahop Gold, into the same dosing vessel and dose them into the beer simultaneously?</strong>\r\n\r\n<em>Yes you can, but be aware that when combining the products, you are essentially diluting both and affecting the concentrations of the components. Care should be taken to determine the proper ratios of the hop acids and calculate the dosing volumes and rates required.

It was the beginning of World War I, which was followed by Prohibition and Depression – all not conducive to support a start-up hop business. But despite all odds, his business grew because of his initiative to look for customers outside the United States. In particular, John I. built strong relationships with Canadian brewers who, not surprisingly, were benefiting greatly from American Prohibition. In 1925, Haas acquired its first hop farm in the Fraser Valley of British Columbia (which eventually grew to 1,300 acres). By 1931, John I. sensed a change in what the world’s brewers were looking for. Up to that time, the most endearing quality of American hops was their low price (based on efficient farming units and strong yields) but their quality was dismal.John I. set out to change that paradigm by buying a farm in Yakima, Washington and implementing a program to reduce the seed content and improve the picking quality of his hops.\r\n\r\nIn addition to his excellent timing (1933 was the repeal of Prohibition), brewers responded so favorably to his quality oriented hop farms (branded as Yakima and improve Golding Farms) that Haas eventually became the largest private hop grower in the world with 25 farms and almost 4,000 acres.'),(9979,1103,'_about-history_1_about-history-left','field_548f0e74607f3'),(9980,1103,'about-history_1_about-history-right','<!-- <a href=\"http://www.johnihaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-68\" src=\"http://www.johnihaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond.jpg\" alt=\"prohibition-beyond\" width=\"293\" height=\"149\" /></a> -->\r\n<a href=\"http://www.johnihaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-full wp-image-62\" src=\"http://www.johnihaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/12/prohibition-beyond2.jpg\" alt=\"prohibition-beyond2\" width=\"297\" height=\"141\" /></a>'),(9981,1103,'_about-history_1_about-history-right','field_548f0e87607f4'),(9982,1103,'about-history_2_about-history-header','HAAS AND BARTH.

It was the US processing capabilities of Haas that peeked the interest of another market leader, namely Joh. Barth &amp; Sohn, Germany, under the leadership of Henry Barth.

Of course, the travel schedule includes time with Hop Products Australia (HPA), the southernmost arm of the global Barth-Haas Group, with visits to Rostrevor Hop Farm in Victoria and Bushy Park in Tasmania. There will be plenty to see with hop harvest in full swing.

Conference under my belt and I have to say that one of things I am most impressed with is the level of sophistication and knowledge that is exhibited in the craft brewing community.  When I first started coming to the CBC (exactly how long ago I don’t care to acknowledge) it was what some people described as the brewing “wild west”. It was an event where enthusiastic brewers (often over-enthusiastic) were there to informally share experiences and learn many of the basics of producing and marketing their beers.\r\n\r\n[caption id=\"attachment_929\" align=\"alignleft\" width=\"147\"]<a href=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Tim-K-Brewery.jpg\"><img class=\"size-thumbnail wp-image-929\" src=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/Tim-K-Brewery-e1429806601852-147x150.jpg\" alt=\"Tim Kostelecky\" width=\"147\" height=\"150\" /></a> Tim Kostelecky[/caption]\r\n\r\nThis has changed.  Yes, the brewers are still free-spirited (and I hope that never changes), but the craft industry is maturing quickly and even small breweries and start-ups are as serious about the business as the big guys. With over 70 seminars, sponsored demonstrations and events, there are more resources available to brewers than ever before.  Technology leads the way to providing means for quality and consistency, safety and sustainability.  The transition is impressive.\r\n\r\nWe saw that come to life at the Barth-Haas booth where brewer after brewer dropped by and impressed us with their knowledge of hops, hop products and varieties. With their rub-and-sniff technique well practiced, they were able to discern the hops’ aroma characteristics in terms of fruity, citrus, floral…and even catty.  All were anxious to try our experimental beers with new hops and varietal combinations.  And all showed great interest in the introduction of the <a href=\"http://haas.shotgunflat8.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/04/haas_csc_one-page_nocrops.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">Haas BBC Pure Hop Pellet™</a> which has great potential for significantly improving beer processing and decreasing product losses.  Quality, efficiency, cost, sustainability, ease-of-use…these are all increasingly important aspects to craft brewers, much more evident than has been seen in the past.  It’s a great time to be part of the movement, and its great to see so many others who enjoy it as much as I do.

16:14:44','The explosion in the craft beer industry has placed an incredible demand on the hops industry. This is especially true with the popularity of the India Pale Ale (IPA) beer style whose primary flavor characteristic is from hops…a lot of hops — in most cases ten times more hops per barrel than the average beer!\r\n\r\nWith craft brewing growing at about 15% volume per year, the impact on hop demand is a magnitude greater. So what’s a hop company to do? How do we not simply react, but be proactive as well? And I do mean ‘we’ because, as much as we compete with other hop companies, it is best for all of us if we are all in sync with what our brewers need. Here are some of the steps Haas is taking to meet the demand of our customers.\r\n\r\n<strong>More hop acreage</strong>\r\n\r\nIt may seem obvious but it isn\'t always easy. In addition to the land needed to meet the demand for these popular craft hop varieties, we also need to be certain of sufficient irrigation as well as increased processing capacity to provide the supply assurance vital to our customers.\r\n\r\n<strong>More accessibility to hops</strong>\r\n\r\nAnother change brought about by the craft beer boom is, of course, the number of breweries demanding these flavor-laden hops — now approaching 4,000 in the U.S. alone. To meet the need of a greater number of brewers and the smaller order sizes involved, Haas collaborates with Willamette Valley Hops as a channel partner out of Oregon to ensure brewers have access to the hops they need to succeed.\r\n\r\n<strong>More hop varieties</strong>\r\n\r\nIn addition to meeting the demand for more hops and greater accessibility, craft brewers have an insatiable thirst for new hop varieties with bold and distinctive hop flavors. Robust fruity and citrus flavors, such as apricot, strawberry, melon, kiwi fruit, and even coconut, are now in the forefront of hop variety development — and a big part of the Haas hop breeding efforts. In fact, Haas is part of the Hop Breeding Company LLC, sharing equally in a joint venture with Select Botanicals LLC which has been instrumental in the development of the vastly popular hop varieties Citra®, Mosaic® and Equinox™.\r\n\r\n<strong>More to come</strong>\r\n\r\nWho knows where this hopsession (sorry, I couldn’t resist) with flavor will take the craft industry. But one thing I know for certain is that Haas will be doing our best to deliver the hops, hop products, supply assurance, technical support and innovations brewers need to succeed. Our new BBC Pure Hop Pellet we introduced at CBC is a good example of that. But that deserves its own blog post. Stay tuned!','Hops.

garnered a great deal of attention in the brewing world recently, and there is much to be learned about the marriage of hops and beer. The Barth-Haas Group developed the Hops Academy with this in mind - a goal to educate brewers about hops, and how to use hops and hop products to the brewers’ advantage. The academy’s courses are given world-wide and have been accredited by Germany’s Institute of Masters of Beer (IMB) as an integral part of their professional training certificate program.\r\n\r\nThat is all good and well, but the Barth-Haas Hops Academy course in Yakima during the hop harvest is special. It’s in the center of the world’s second largest hop growing area (neck and neck with the Hallertau region of Germany), and if you haven’t experienced the awesomeness of exploring a fully mature hop “garden” or seen hop harvesting in action, you’re in for a real experience. But the Hops Academy course is not just tours of hop fields, harvesting, and social events. It is designed as an introductory educational foray into hops and provides enough technical depth to provide a deeper look into the workings of <em>Humulus lupulus</em>, and why hops are so unique and important for brewers. Specialists from both the U.S. and Germany will be there to give insights into the different aspects of hops and brewing including:\r\n<ul>\r\n	<li>Hop botany and cultivation</li>\r\n	<li>Breeding and new variety development</li>\r\n	<li>Hop products and their applications, including pellets, CO2 extract, even advanced products</li>\r\n	<li>Hop chemistry, quality, and sensory analysis, of both hops and beer</li>\r\n</ul>\r\nDon’t worry about the chemistry if you’re not a brewing geek – some of the information may be over your head, but you won’t be overwhelmed. And much of the insight you gain will help you understand and appreciate the benefits and hops and how to best utilize them to your advantage. However, if you <span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">are</span> technically savvy, you won’t be bored. You can interact with highly knowledgeable experts who can help you with any of your questions or issues regarding hops and beer.\r\n\r\nTo best provide an intimate experience, this Hops Academy program in Yakima will be a small group, limited to just 30 participants. In addition, our aim for the program is to be not just educational but entertaining with some fun built in … including our evening BBQ at the Haas traditional Bavarian beer garden.\r\n\r\nRegistration is $350. As I mentioned, space is limited and we’re only weeks away. Inquire directly to me at <a href=\"mailto:tim.kostelecky@johnihaas.com\">tim.kostelecky@johnihaas.com</a> for further information and to register for the course.

Schönberger, Manager Technical Sales at Barth Haas Group\r\n\r\nIf you stopped by our booth at this year\'s CBC, then you got a sneak preview of the latest creation from Barth-Haas: The <a href=\"http://www.johnihaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/07/Haas-BBC-Pure-Hop-Pellet.pdf\">BBC Pure Hop Pellet™</a>. Yes, that’s BBC, as in Boston Beer Company, co-collaborator on the pellet and a driving force in its innovation and development. Also collaborating on the innovation was Dr. Christina Schönberger, Manager of Technical Sales at Barth-Haas. I recently caught up with Christina about the BBC Pure Hop Pellet™ and got at least a couple of pints worth of insight and information behind the pellet. So pull up a bar stool and listen in.\r\n\r\n<strong>Haas (H):</strong> <em>OK, let me start with the obvious. Haas makes the pellet but it’s called the BBC – Boston Beer Company – Pure Hop Pellet™. What’s that all about?</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>Dr. Christina Schönberger (CS):</strong> Overall, the hops and brewing industries are pretty collaborative, and Barth-Haas has always had a good relationship with Boston Beer. About twice a year, we would meet with them to brainstorm ways to help them develop ways to better use hops in their process. Boston Beer was a major contributor in the development of the enhanced pellet, so naming it gives them the credit they deserve.\r\n\r\n<strong>H:</strong> <em>That makes sense. So what about the other half of the name? What makes it so “pure”?</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>CS:</strong> Mainly it’s about efficiency and flavor. Regarding efficiency, a huge amount of hop loss occurs in brewing many craft beer styles, often with dry hopping. Problems with the separation of the vegetation component of the hops can lead to expensive downtime. And the hop vegetation absorbs a lot of beer, which contributes to the losses.\r\n\r\n<strong>H:</strong> <em>Kind of like letting the baby out with the bathwater?</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>CS: </strong>[Chuckling] That’s an interesting metaphor, but I guess you’re right. Boston Beer believes in using the whole hop in their process because they believe it adds many important flavor components to the final beer. A challenge was to develop a pellet that would break up and distribute effectively in the cold temperatures associated with dry-hopping.\r\n\r\n<strong style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">H: </strong><em style=\"line-height: 1.5;\">How were you able to do that?</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>CS:</strong> Well, fortunately, we had great knowledge and experience in hops technology with Dr. Adrian Forster as part of the Barth-Haas Group. He was able to develop a process using sieving that allowed us to create a pellet with a finer and more uniform particle size. This helped in improving the brewing performance in terms of both processing and flavor.\r\n\r\n<strong>H: </strong><em>So it was a win-win? You were able to get better disintegration of the pellet which led to less waste and down time. And at the same time, the hop flavor was not compromised.</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>CS: </strong>Yes. In fact, the Boston Beer brewers found that the improved pellets provided a higher level in hop flavor and aroma than was seen with the regular T90 pellets.\r\n\r\n<strong>H:</strong> <em>So does that mean they could use fewer hops to achieve the same flavor as before?</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>CS:</strong> They could. Or they could use the same volume of hops as before and create a hoppier beer. It’s up to them.\r\n\r\n<strong>H:</strong> <em>So do you make the BBC Pure Hop Pellet™ only for Boston Beer?</em>\r\n\r\n<strong>CS:</strong> Oh no. As I mentioned before, Boston Beer is very collaborative and along with Barth-Haas, we very excited to share this innovation with the rest of the brewing world. It will be fun to see what everyone does with it.\r\n\r\n&nbsp;','The BBC Pure Hop Pellet.

Haas up in Yakima—developed a new variety called HBC369. They wanted to share the new hop with a select group of brewers and wanted to see how the brewers would use it. Karl Strauss was one of the select few breweries that got to play with HBC369, but only with tiny little bits of it. “Our brewers were immediately intrigued by it,” Chris recalls. “It was so distinctly aromatic. It had such incredible grapefruit, tropical fruit, passion fruit, and peach aromas to it. It was citrusy and crisp, and it was an unusual hop in that you could use it for both aromatics and for bittering.” So, in 2013, the brewers at Karl Strauss gave the growers an order to send as much HBC369 as they could.</p>\r\n<a href=\"http://www.sandiegomagazine.com/Blogs/Behind-the-Brews/Summer-2015/I-Married-a-Hop/\" target=\"_blank\">READ MORE</a>','\"I Married a Hop\"','Mosaic Session Ale began development in 2012, when the Hop Breeding Company—a consortium of hop farmers and John I.

Para o Grupo Barth- Haas ela começou na cidade de São Paulo com duas noites da Hops Academy (nossa Academia de Lúpulos) realizada no Instituto da Cerveja Brasil, onde um grupo de 20 pessoas – de cervejeiros caseiros a artesanais e até mesmo cervejeiros de duas grandes cervejerias – recebeu informações valiosas sobre esta planta preciosa, variedades, seleção de lúpulos, processamento, produtos e aplicações. Os três dias que se seguiram foram tomados por atividades relacionadas à Brasil Brau em si. E nossa semana finalmente terminou aproximadamente 900 km ao sul de onde começou, mais precisamente na linda cidade de Bento Gonçalves, na Serra Gaúcha, em uma reunião na sede da LNF Latino Americana, nossos distribuidores exclusivos para o setor de “Cervejas Artesanais” no Brasil, Uruguai e Paraguai.\r\n\r\nEm nossa estação de demonstração de nosso “Pure Hop Aroma” (PHA) os cervejeiros tiveram a chance para aprender sobre esta linha de produtos e suas vantagens em relação ao processo de dry-hopping no que se refere à redução de perdas de cerveja, facilidade de dosagem e sua flexibilidade no desenvolvimento de novas cervejas. Um fardo aberto de lúpulo Cascade em flor causou inesperado encanto quando cervejeiros simplismente tiveram a oportunidade de sentir o lúpulo com suas próprias mãos, colher amostras e fazer uma rápida avaliação sensorial do mesmo.\r\n\r\n<a name=\"English\"></a>\r\n\r\nConforme o mercado brasileiro de cervejas artesanais amadurece em ritmo acelerado, podemos certamente afirmar nossa presença no mesmo com um dos slogans exibidos em nosso estande, o qual dizia: “Loucos por lúpulos. Loucos para ajudá-los a desenvolver sua próxima grande cerveja.” Esta é a nossa missão… Do lúpulo para a torneira!\r\n\r\nSaúde!\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n\r\n&nbsp;\r\n<h3>BRAZIL BRAU JULY 2015</h3>\r\nThe Brasil Brau week was undoubtedly full and fruitful. For the Barth-Haas Group it started out in São Paulo City with two evenings of our Hops Academy at the <em>Instituto da Cerveja Brasil</em>, where a group of 20+ people – from home through craft brewers and a few from two very large breweries – were given valuable information about our precious plant, varieties, hop selection, processing, products and applications. The following three days were filled with activities related to the trade show itself. And our week finally ended about 900 km south of where it started, more precisely in the beautiful city of Bento Gonçalves, RS, in a business meeting with our exclusive partner distributor <em>LNF Latino Americana</em> for the Craft Brewing sector in Brazil, Uruguay and Paraguay.\r\n\r\nAt our <em>Pure Hop Aroma (PHA)</em> demonstration station, brewers really took their time to learn about the product line and its advantages related to dry-hopping when it comes to reduced beer losses, ease of application and flexibility for the development of new beers. An open bale of Cascade raw hop caused an unexpected delight when brewers could simply stick their hands in it, take samples and do some casual rub-and sniff activities.\r\n\r\nAs the Brazilian craft beer market matures at such an amazingly fast pace, we can certainly affirm our presence in it with one of the slogans displayed on our booth, which read in Brazilian Portuguese: <em>“Wild about hops. Dedicated to help you develop your next great-tasting beer!” </em>This is our goal… From Hop to Tap!\r\n\r\nProst!','Brasil Brau July 2015','The Brasil Brau week was undoubtedly full and fruitful.

And it’s no surprise; the dog days of the summer finally give way to crisp nights and beautifully dry, sunny weather. Here in Yakima, the heart of the world’s largest hop growing area, September is especially golden—actually, a rich, golden green. It’s hop harvest time; a period of anticipation and excitement for those of us intimately involved and deeply passionate about what it takes to craft incredible beers.\r\n\r\nThe six-week harvest ramps up during the waning weeks of August and continues on through September. It’s the culmination of a long year of planning, planting and babying our beloved hops. There’s tons of activity during the harvest with farm operations in full swing for hop take-in and hop quality evaluations. But the highlight of the month for us here at Haas is when the brewers’ begin their annual visits.\r\n\r\nIn years past, Haas has always enjoyed welcoming interested brewers to our farms and facilities each September. As the number of U.S. brewers approaches 4,000, the yearly trek to Yakima has boomed. Many of our customers will be visiting the Haas facilities this year during harvest. It’s a fun, busy and sometimes hectic time of year—but it’s exciting that so many brewers put as much focus on great hops as we do. We do everything we can to make sure they have a great experience while they’re here.\r\n\r\nSpeaking for all of us at Haas—the farm and processing team, the sales team, and the technical and leadership groups—it’s almost impossible to over-emphasize how much we value the personal, trusting relationships forged during the brewers’ visits. Maybe for some, the visit to the hop fields and operations is more of a necessity; part of their job. But, when it comes to the vast majority of brewers I share time with, I get the sense that it’s much more. A welcomed break from the day to day. A chance to learn (and taste!) something new. And, maybe most of all, a festive celebration of the science, art and craft of brewing!','HOP HARVEST.

the importance of playing an active part in the community of Yakima, and with this comes a responsibility that we as a company hold close to our values.  Haas provides support in the efforts of a number of organizations that help Yakima thrive.\r\n\r\nRecently, Haas has showed support to four such organizations:\r\n\r\nCapitol Theater\r\nThe iconic Capitol Theater is considered to be the gem of Yakima\'s cultural scene.  Haas enthusiastically supports its ongoing programs that bring a wide variety of internationally renown lecturers, music, and other high-level cultural events to the Yakima Area. &lt;pictured:  ç&gt;\r\n\r\n<a href=\"http://www.johnihaas.com/wp-content/uploads/2015/09/Capital.jpg\"><img class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-1076\"

support the work of the Union Gospel Mission\'s Madison House, which offers programs for broadening the horizons for young people in our community who are surrounded by poverty, substance abuse and gang activity.  The Madison house provides guidance in personal responsibility and developing character growth in young, at-risk individuals in the community. &lt;pictured: John Gorman, Sr. Director

As much fun as Hop Harvest can be, this is not just a casual stroll through the hop fields and social gatherings.\r\n\r\nAt the Barth-Haas Hops Academy, brewers large and small get a chance to take part in intimate and highly interactive experiences.

Haas, Inc.\r\n\r\nThis year, we were pleased to welcome guest lecturers Jason Perrault and Zac German from Select Botanicals Group, LLC in the Yakima Valley. Haas partnered with Select Botanicals many years ago to form a joint venture known as the Hop Breeding Company (HBC). HBC is well known for the development of Citra<sup>®</sup>, Mosaic<sup>®</sup> hops, as well as the recently released Equinox<sup>®</sup> hop variety.\r\n\r\nThe program is not all serious stuff, though. Aside from the lectures and presentations, there’s the wonder of the hops in the field and the excitement of the harvest. And, of course, there is plenty of beer tasting! During the course, a selection of single-hop variety beers produced at the Haas Innovations Brewery were highlighted illustrating the vast potential of flavorful hops and the amazing contributions they provide to beer.\r\n\r\nWe also had lots to celebrate. Each year, the Barth-Haas Hops Academy is proud to be sponsor of a <a href=\"http://www.pinkbootssociety.org\" target=\"_blank\">Pink Boots Society</a> scholarship, created to empower women beer professionals to advance their careers in the beer industry through education. This year’s scholarship went to Cheyenne McCarthy from <a href=\"http://www.fallbrookbrewing.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Fallbrook Brewing</a> in Los Angeles. Congratulations Cheyenne!\r\n\r\nAnd as a special recognition, the Hops Academy hosted a pair of 2015 champion beer sommeliers from July\'s world competition in Rio de Janeiro; the Brazilian champion, Gil Lebre Abbade Franco, and the World Champion, Simonmattia Riva, (check out our interview with <a href=\"http://hopflavors.blogspot.de/2015/09/simonmattia-riva-world-champion-of.html\" target=\"_blank\">Simonmattia</a>).
